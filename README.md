This project, developed in C++ by myself and two fellow students, was conceived during our Data Structures course. Our aim was not to create something overly complex, but rather to build an efficient and effective system. Leveraging trees as a primary data structure alongside advanced sorting algorithms, we sought to manage student records seamlessly.

Features:
File-based Data Input: The system reads all data from a file, adhering to the instruction to minimize reliance on user input.
Efficient Processing:  Designed to handle thousands of student records with minimal time and space complexity.


How you can access it:
Clone the repository:
Compile the source files.
Run the executable.

Contributions:
We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the system. Feel free to open issues or pull requests.

Acknowledgements:
We would like to express our gratitude to our instructor for guiding us through the development process and to the open-source community for invaluable resources and inspiration.Through collaborative effort, this project deepened our understanding of data structures.
